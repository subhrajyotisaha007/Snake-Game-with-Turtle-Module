# Snake-Game-with-Turtle-Module
This is Simple Snake gmae, it's made with turtle Module so no need to import any extra packages.
I made some different class to make it easier. Anyone can made changes if want.
in main.py only I add and import all the classes and just arrange it. Score.py will collect the points, Snake.py is all about the snake body you can change the colour of the snake also if you want and finally food.py and bigfood.py both are same you can say, if you have any idea how to make easier please feel free to do.
We can call it PYTHON game though (❁´◡`❁)
